## Getting Telegram API Credentials

2. Log in with your phone number
3. Create a new application
4. Copy the `api_id` and `api_hash`
5. Use these in your `.env` file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Phone number is banned"**
   - Try using a different phone number
   - Make sure the number is active and not banned by Telegram
   - Use a number that hasn't been used for API access before

2. **"Failed to connect to API"**
   - Make sure the backend is running on port 3001
   - Check that CORS is properly configured
   - Verify your `.env` file exists and has correct values

3. **"Invalid verification code"**
   - Check your Telegram app for the code
   - Make sure you're entering the code correctly
   - Try requesting a new code

4. **"Failed to fetch groups"**
   - Make sure you're logged in first
   - Verify your session string is valid
   - Try logging out and logging in again

5. **"No messages found"**
   - The group might not have recent activity
   - You might not have access to message history
   - Try increasing the number of days to analyze

### Phone Number Format

- Always include the country code (e.g., +91 for India)
- Don't include spaces or special characters
- Example: `+919876543210`

## Development
